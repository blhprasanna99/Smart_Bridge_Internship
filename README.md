# Smart_Bridge_Internship
This repository contains project done during smart bridge educational services internship.

Agriculture is one of the origins of human sustenance in this world.
Nowadays, due to growing population people need the greater productive
capability of the agriculture to meet the demands. In olden days, people used
natural methods to increase the productivity, such as using the cow dung as a
fertilizer in the fields which resulted in an increase in the productivity enough to
meet the requirements of the population. But later people thought of earning more
profits by getting more outcome. So, there came a revolution called “Green
Revolution”.

After revolution usage of deadly poisons as herbicides has increased to a
drastic level. By doing so farmers got success in increasing the productivity but
they have forgotten the damage done to the environment, which will raise a doubt
in sustenance on this beautiful earth. So, this project implements some methods to
reduce the usage of herbicides by spraying them only in the areas where weed is
present.
